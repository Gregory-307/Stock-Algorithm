# Stock-Algorithm
Some of the Scripts used in my Stock-Algorithm.

I learnt code alongside writing the program so some of it is both inefficient and ineffective 
and some is just plain old wrong.

I've started both the modularisation and optimisation processes now that should speed up everything
by 10-100fold.

The program should be easier to use and more effective, especially when using bigger pcs.
I was also on a bad laptop, so optimisation wasn't an issue before.

This is all to make way for my Mark IV which will be a full blown A.I. with Keras Neural Networks and a memory, 
I.e. it will learn overtime. 

Not all my new and improved scripts are on here, but for nicer code, check out the optimisation folder.
